2048
=========

AI for the 2048 game based on simple expectimax search. The base game engine is using the code from [here](https://gist.github.com/lewisjdeane/752eeba4635b479f8bb2). 

Modelled the AI player as a max player, and the computer as a chance player (picking a random open spot and placing a 2-tile). Implemented the expectimax algorithm to compute decisions for the AI player.
